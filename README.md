# Breast-Cancer-Detection
**Overview**
This project implements a machine learning model to detect breast cancer using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn. The model utilizes logistic regression to classify tumors as malignant or benign, achieving 92% accuracy on the test data.
Dataset
The project uses the built-in Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn, which includes various features computed from digitized images of breast mass. Each feature describes characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

**Features include:**
Mean radius
Mean texture
Mean perimeter
Mean area
Mean smoothness
And other cellular characteristics

**Dependencies**
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib (for visualizations)

**Data Preprocessing**
Loading data from sklearn.datasets
Data cleaning and normalization
Feature scaling
Train-test split

**Model Training**
Algorithm: Logistic Regression
Hyperparameter tuning
Model evaluation

**Results**
Model Accuracy: 92% on test data

**Train model and make predictions**

Future Improvements
Implement additional machine learning algorithms for comparison
Add cross-validation
Feature importance analysis
Deploy model as a web application
